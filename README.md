# Coursework - Merge

- This shall eventually be the branch that the master branch merges with. 

## Setup Instructions:
- Requires `npm` 

If you don't have npm, run this:
- `curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh`
and then:
- `npm install` 
in both directories.


## Task list:
- Ensure pages are accessible
- Integrating front-end and back-end 

## Issues:
- A lot of In-line CSS styling. Will need to either remove, or move to main stylesheet.
- Difference in pages being queried
